1. What Went Well:

*   Your footwork was excellent during several rallies, especially between [Timestamp if available, or describe the rally e.g., "the rally at the end of the second game"].  You consistently covered the court effectively.
*   Your serve was consistently strong and accurate, placing your opponent under pressure.  Many serves at the start of the game were particularly effective.
*   Your net play showed improvement, specifically your ability to anticipate shots, even if the execution could be enhanced.  For example, your drop shot at [Timestamp or description] was quite effective in disrupting your opponent’s rhythm.


2. Key Areas to Work On:

*   **Clearance of the shuttle:**  Several times, you hit the shuttlecock weakly, allowing your opponent to easily recover and counterattack. We need to focus on generating more power and consistency behind your shots.  
*   **Consistency of your return of serve:**  While your serve is strong, the consistency of your return of serve can be improved.  Your opponent often gained an advantage by winning the point after your serve.

3. Practice Drills:

*   **Power and precision drills:**  We'll focus on drills that emphasize generating more power in your shots without sacrificing accuracy. This includes shadow swings, focusing on the correct technique and full extension. We’ll also use drills involving hitting to specific targets on the court.
*   **Return of serve drills:**  We’ll work on consistent, controlled returns. We can practice receiving different types of serves (high, low, fast, slow) with a focus on precise placement and powerful returns.  We can also incorporate reaction drills to improve your response time.


4. Weekly Goals:

*   Focus on hitting the shuttle with more power and consistency during rallies, aiming for at least 70% of your shots to land in your designated target area during practice.
*   Improve the consistency of your return of serve, aiming to win at least 60% of the points immediately following your serve in practice matches.
*   Review and implement the feedback from our practice drills during your next game.
