==================================================

1. What Went Well:

*   Your footwork was consistently quick and agile during the rallies, especially between 0:45 and 1:15 in the second game.  You covered the court effectively.
*   Your serve was consistently accurate and placed well, creating several scoring opportunities.  The placement to the backhand corner at 2:30 in the first game was particularly effective.
*   Your positive attitude and determination were evident throughout the match. You never gave up!


2. Key Areas to Work On:

*   **Consistency of Shot Placement:** While your shots were often powerful, there was some inconsistency in your placement, leading to several unforced errors.  This was noticeable during the mid-game rallies in both sets.
*   **Net Play:** Your net play needs improvement, specifically your net shots were often too long or lacked sufficient control. This cost you several crucial points.


3. Practice Drills:

*   **Target Practice:** Set up targets on the court and focus on hitting specific areas consistently. Start with slow, controlled shots, gradually increasing the speed. This will help improve shot accuracy.
*   **Net Play Drills:** Practice drop shots, net kills, and quick reflexes at the net.  Start with a partner feeding you easy lifts close to the net, then gradually make the lifts more challenging.
*   **Footwork Drills:**  Practice shuttle runs and agility drills to further improve your court coverage and quick reaction time.  Focus on quick lateral movements and sharp turns.


4. Weekly Goals:

*   Focus on hitting 80% of your shots within your intended target area during practice.
*   Win at least 70% of your net exchanges during practice sessions.
*   Improve your agility and quickness by completing all footwork drills consistently and accurately throughout the week.

Remember, consistent practice and focus on these areas will significantly improve your game.  Keep up the hard work and the positive attitude – I'm confident you'll see great progress!
